## Introduction

## Getting Started

To get started with Portfolionaire, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolionaire.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd portfolionaire`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the command: `node node.js`
5. Create your database on MongoDB and paste the host link, database name and collection name in the 'node.js' file.
   In order to make it easy for you, I have copy pasted the content of the database in the file 'data.js' which is directly linked to the page.
   This is done so that while testing the app, you don't need to create a database and load data onto it.
6. Run the application: `npm start`
7. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access Portfolionaire.
